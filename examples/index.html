      <h1>YouTube iframe API sequence mashup</h1>

      <p>
      This page demonstrates how simple it is to embed a sequence of YouTube clips using the new Youtube iframe API, along with <a href="youtube-remix.js">youtube-remix.js</a>.  The current version works best with Chrome.
      </p>

      <p>
      Start by placing a div tag in your document.  You can style this div tag however you want, to match the layout or positioning of your theme.  Next, configure your mashup.  Take a look at the source for this HTML file, and you'll see a variable called <b>mash_cfg</b>.  This page's configuration will turn the div ID "example_player" into a youtube chromeless player, set its dimensions to 640x390, use a fading effect to transition between segments, and play a sequence of video segments.  As the last step, it invokes <b>youtube-remix.js</b> which takes care of the rest!
      </p>

      <div id="example_player"></div>

      <p>
      The coolest part about the iframe API is that it is compatible with Flash and HTML5, so make sure you test this page twice.  First, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">opt into the YouTube HTML5 trial, here</a>.  Then, leave the HTML5 trial and load this page a second time to test out the Flash version.  The best part about <b>youtube-remix.js</b> is that you don't need to know any javascript at all to use it.  Everything is controlled right here, in this HTML file!  For another example, <a href="news.html">take a look at this.</a>
      </p>

    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var mash_cfg = {
        'id': 'example_player', // the ID of the div tag that will contain video
        'height': '390', // height of the player
        'width': '640', // width of the player
        'hide_when_finished': true, // after the final segment, fade the player away
        'fade': true, // use the fade transition effect
        'sequence': "(<u1zgFlCw8Aw, 22s, 28s>, <u1zgFlCw8Aw, 127s, 140s>, <L5ebSn9HgJ4, 3019s, 3040s>, <u1zgFlCw8Aw, 195s, 199s>)" // a list of youtube IDs, and start/stop times
      };
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="youtube-remix.js"></script>
